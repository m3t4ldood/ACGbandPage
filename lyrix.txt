giving into childish dreams
acting out of the ordinary
hating the ones you love
the only mistake
is when you give up...

so far out of reach
why does everyone run away from me
i cant do this alone
breaking down what i used to be
a free spirit emerges deep with in me

i have lost something so precious deep inside
no matter how long i search i know ill never find
the missing pieces of my life are lost amongst the stars
this life is like a fucking cage im trapped behind the bars...

all my friends have fallen away from me
if i dont find myself ill never be set free
i have to distance myself from you
through my lonelyness i know ill find the truth...

how can i follow you if you are lost as well
this life is torture and it feels like im in hell
you lied to me and said that all i need is love
with out the missing pieces ill never rise above.


The darkest shade of blue 
could not keep me from you 
I had to bring you back to save my life, 
death tried to take you from me 
so in return I had to bleed 
I sacrificed my self for you, 
# I don't need anything 
all I ever wanted was you, 
I'd spill my blood for your love 
my life means nothing with out you...

 expressing me...

i cant let the blood hit the floor
if i do i will be no more
i feel like such a whore
cus i give into this lie...

i take it all in stride
as i swallow my pride
wishing that i had died
cus my life is so untrue...

my life is insanity
dealing with inhumanity
these thoughts a necessity
its a means to get by...

been laying here for days
my loneliness is not a phase
with all these things i regret
am i dead yet?

im shaking cus i cant 
take the weight of life
i cant look at you cus of 
the shame i hide
i cant speak up for my self
cus the things i say are lies
i dont need your fucking help
to get me through my life...

i take it all in stride
as i swallow my pride
wishing that i had died
cus my life is so untrue...
